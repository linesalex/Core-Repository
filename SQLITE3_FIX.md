# SQLite3 Module Error Fix

## Problem
The error `Error: \\?\C:\...\node_sqlite3.node is not a valid Win32 application.` occurs when a Linux-compiled sqlite3 native binary is accidentally committed to the repository and then used on Windows.

## Root Cause
In commit `360992a1a`, the file `backend/node_modules/sqlite3/build/Release/node_sqlite3.node` was accidentally committed. This is a platform-specific native binary that was compiled for Linux but cannot run on Windows.

## Solution
1. **Removed the problematic binary** from the repository
2. **Updated .gitignore** to prevent future commits of sqlite3 native binaries
3. **Created rebuild scripts** to help developers rebuild sqlite3 for their platform

## Fix Applied
- Deleted: `backend/node_modules/sqlite3/build/Release/node_sqlite3.node`
- Updated: `.gitignore` to exclude sqlite3 build artifacts
- Added: Platform-specific rebuild scripts

## For Windows Users
To fix this issue on your Windows machine:

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```cmd
   cd backend
   ```

2. Run the rebuild script:
   ```cmd
   rebuild-sqlite3.bat
   ```

   Or manually:
   ```cmd
   npm uninstall sqlite3
   npm install sqlite3
   ```

3. Test the application:
   ```cmd
   npm start
   ```

## For Linux/macOS Users
If you encounter similar issues:

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Run the rebuild script:
   ```bash
   ./rebuild-sqlite3.sh
   ```

   Or manually:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall sqlite3
   npm install sqlite3
   ```

## Prevention
The `.gitignore` file now includes rules to prevent sqlite3 native binaries from being committed:

```
# SQLite3 native binaries - these should be rebuilt per platform
**/node_modules/sqlite3/build/
**/node_modules/sqlite3/lib/binding/
*.node
```

## Technical Details
- SQLite3 uses native C++ modules that must be compiled for the specific platform (Windows, Linux, macOS) and architecture (x64, ARM, etc.)
- These binaries are automatically built during `npm install` based on the current platform
- Committing these binaries to version control causes cross-platform compatibility issues
- The fix ensures sqlite3 is properly rebuilt for each developer's platform
